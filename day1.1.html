        Once upon a time, there was a <b>thirsty crow</b> who was
        <i>flying</i> in
        <u>search</u>
        of water. After a long <ins> this is a text</ins>search, the crow
        finally <sup> hello </sup>found a <strike> egrbr </strike>pitcher with
        some water at the bottom. The crow tried to drink the water, but its
        beak could <del>delete this</del> not reach the<mark> water </mark>
        because the level was too low.</big

        The crow thought for a moment and then had a clever idea. It picked up
        some small pebbles and dropped them one by one into the pitcher. Slowly,
        the water began to rise. After adding enough pebbles, the water level
        was high enough for the crow to drink.</small

      The crow <cite> kgjvkw </cite>drank the water and was no longer thirsty.
      It felt very proud of its ingenuity and <q> flew </q>away, wiser and
      happier. This story teaches us the value of thinking creatively to solve
      problems. The Thirsty Crow shows that with
      <def> THis is a text </def> determination and resourcefulness, we can find
      solutions even in challenging <strong> hee </strong> <em> situations.</em>
